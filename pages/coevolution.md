this is a stub for ideas about how we ought to partition the world into
(distinct) organisms. The main contribution is the idea that if we consider all
instances of interdependence as a form of symbiosis, and we consider all
instances of symbiosis as a reason to 'merge' organisms, then we don't have any
distinct organisms.  It may also be useful to phrase things in terms of generic
dynamical systems in which we have a certain set of feedback mechanisms which we
call life. How do we decide what the minimum requirements are for such feedback
cycles to persist? How do we decide what counts as an instance of pattern (which
is feeding back?) blah, blah blah...
