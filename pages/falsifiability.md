title: Who needs falsifiability when your brainstorming

There are few concepts out there where it strikes me that the requirement of
falsifiability is overly strict. An example that is currently on my mind is
Kevin Kelly's notion of the Technium. This is the global technological
super-organism which has a rich personality that is skillfully narrated by the
slighlty-less-than-scientfically-rigorous Kevin Kelly. It is natural to ask
whether we can make any falsifiable claims about the Technium. And if not, then
why should we believe it?

I'm tempted to say that we should be content to permit these models as longs as
they are serving some other purpose. For example, if we find that the concept of
hte Technium helps us grasp the existence of a large system of technological
interdependence, that seems fine. Perhaps it hasn't made any falsifiable claims,
but it has led those who encounter this concept to ask a different set of
questions, which only become relevant once you start thinking about the Technium
every once in a while. Perhaps this can be summarized by the claim that
falsifiability should not be a requirement for legitimacy. An unfalsifiable
theory, which has other pragmatic benefits may still be useful.
