Watching *Is the man who is tall happy* reminded me of my days of puzzlement
over the nature of reference.  From what I can tell this is a common stage in
the life of someone with an analytical attitude towards language.  At some point
we find ourselves asking about the mechanics of semantics and we start
to wonder about how we communally agree on "what a word means", how we
verify that someone is really correct when they make linguistic claims about
"the way things are", or perhaps we are so abruptly reminded of the "real" world
after a long adventure in formal langauges, that the very idea of real objects
requires closer inspection.  This is probably as I should go without broaching
my next main bone to pick about referentialism: the terminology of reference
(which sadly, is a proper level of self-reference, but let's just set that aside
for now). The rest of this discussion stems from not only my puzzlment with the
concept of reference, but my puzzlement about the way that other people talk
about reference.
